# Open key of the Megalothorax species of the world (Collembola: Neelidae)

## How to use
The XML file can be imported on the [Xper<sup>3</sup>](https://www.xper3.fr) for manual edition and publication of the interative key. The present database is made open-source to ensure any further authors to use it and update it at their discretion in future work, without be bound to the initial contributor(s).
However, the most sensible practice is a collaborative managment. Any new contributor is welcome to this repository and to the original Xper<sup>3</sup> upon simple request; and without any obligation else than appropriate communication among contributors when applying a significant change or correction to the repository.
Typical updates may be small corrections or precisions, no necessarily related to a new publication (minor update e.g. v1.00 -> v1.01) or addition of new species or redescribed species (major update e.g. v1.01 -> v2.00).
