# Open key of the Megalothorax species of the world (Collembola: Neelidae)

## How to use
The present database is made open-source to ensure any further authors to use it and update it at their discretion in future work, without being bound to the initial contributor(s). The XML file can be imported on the [Xper<sup>3</sup>](https://www.xper3.fr) for manual edition and publication of the interative key.

However, the most sensible practice is to avoid copies proliferation through a collaborative managment. Any new contributor is welcome to this repository and to the original Xper<sup>3</sup>  upon simple request; and without any obligation else than appropriate communication among contributors when applying a significant change or correction to the repository.

Recommended workflow is to update the data interactively with Xper<sup>3</sup>, and deposit an export of the data in XML (data and metadata) and CSV (data only) here for version control and accessiblity. Typical updates may be small corrections or precisions, no necessarily related to a new publication (minor update e.g. v1.00 -> v1.01) or addition of new species or redescribed species (major update e.g. v1.01 -> v2.00). To work privately, it is possible to import the last XML file on a private Xper<sup>3</sup>, edit the data and export it again in XML (for example to update the original base only after a paper is accepted).

We recommend to cite this key as a public electronic ressource:
